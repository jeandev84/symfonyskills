### Database Design

```php 
PRODUCT
- id (int)
- price (int)




PROMOTION
- id (int)
- name (string)
- type (string)
- adjustment (float)
- criteria (string|json)


==============================================================

id: 1
name: Black Friday half price sale
type: date_range_multiplier
adjustment: 0.5
criteria: {"form": "2022-11-25", "to": "2022-11-28"}

==============================================================

id: 2
name: Voucher OU812
type: fixed_price_voucher
adjustment: 100
criteria: {"code": "OU812"}

===================================================================

$ composer require doctrine

$ bin/console make:entity Product


 created: src/Entity/Product.php
 created: src/Repository/ProductRepository.php
 
 Entity generated! Now let's add some fields!
 You can always add more fields later manually or by re-running this command.

 New property name (press <return> to stop adding fields):
 > price

 Field type (enter ? to see all types) [string]:
 > integer

 Can this field be null in the database (nullable) (yes/no) [no]:
 > 

 updated: src/Entity/Product.php

 Add another property? Enter the property name (or press <return> to stop adding fields):
 > 


           
  Success! 
           

 Next: When you're ready, create a migration with php bin/console make:migration

 Relation type? [ManyToOne, OneToMany, ManyToMany, OneToOne]:
 > ManyToOne

 Is the ProductPromotion.product property allowed to be null (nullable)? (yes/no) [yes]:
 > no

 Do you want to add a new property to Product so that you can access/update ProductPromotion objects from it - e.g. $product->getProductPromotions()? (yes/no) [yes]:
 > 

 A new property will also be added to the Product class so that you can access the related ProductPromotion objects from it.

 New field name inside Product [productPromotions]:
 > 

 Do you want to activate orphanRemoval on your relationship?
 A ProductPromotion is "orphaned" when it is removed from its related Product.
 e.g. $product->removeProductPromotion($productPromotion)
 
 NOTE: If a ProductPromotion may *change* from one Product to another, answer "no".

 Do you want to automatically delete orphaned App\Entity\ProductPromotion objects (orphanRemoval)? (yes/no) [no]:
